# Welcome to the FoxRank messages config file. There are a few rules when editing YML or YAML files.
# This file contains all messages in the plugin. All messages support chat colors and \n for new lines
# 1. NEVER, EVER use tabs. Always use 2 spaces.
# 2. A '#' means the line is commented out. The server will ignore the line.
# 3. If you delete a portion of the config, you can delete the 'messages.yml' and a new one
#    will be automatically generated on the next server restart.
# 4. If you would like to include an apostrophe (') inside the text, you must escape it
#    by including two. `Section: 'Don''t do that!'`
